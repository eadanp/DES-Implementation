For this assignment, you must implement the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm with 
any programming language that you are comfortable with. The recommendation is to use C/C++ 
or Java. You can accomplish this assignment individually or by forming a team of 2 students. 
 
You can utilize the publically available tables/functions in order to implement the DES. You can 
find these permutation tables/functions in some reference books or over the Internet. 
 
You algorithm should get a plaintext as well as a “secret key” from the user and then perform 
encryption (generating the ciphertext from the plaintext) and decryption (generating the original 
plaintext from the ciphertext). 
 
You  can  also  select  any  “mode  of  operations”  that  you  want.  All  the  necessary  technical 
materials are available in the posted lectures on Canvas. 
 
You must submit all related files in a zip file on Canvas (just one file for each group, submitted 
by the group leader). Make sure to include a “ReadMe.txt” file so that I know what you have 
done and how your program can be executed. 
 
You will get one of the following options as your grade for this assignment: 
Completely Satisfactory (CS), Somehow Satisfactory (SS), and Not Satisfactory (NS) 
 
Please don’t copy-and-pasts any code from the Internet. The main objective of this course and 
its assignments is to help you deeply understand these cryptographic algorithms/protocols.
