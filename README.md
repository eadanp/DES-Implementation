This program let a user choose if he wants to encrypt or decrypt a message using DES algorithm with ECB Mode Of Operation, or to exit the program.

Encryption: The user will input a secret message to be encrypted and a secret 8 character password/key.
The output will be the encrypted binary string and the encrypted cipher text.

Decryption: The user will input an encrypted message to be decrypted and a secret 8 character password/key.
The output will be the decrypted cipher text.

**To run the program through VSCode make sure you have a G++ compiler.**
